This work describes the design of an electronically augmented replica of a
16th-century harpsichord keyboard with a typical Renaissance Italian layout. The
keyboard is a collaboration between the \anon{NEMUS project} and the Museo di San Colombano,
which houses the Tagliavini Collection of playable historical keyboard
instruments. The keyboard was commissioned for exhibition purposes and to
enhance the experiential authenticity of the collection. The keyboard emulates
the mechanics of a two-register harpsichord featuring a single manual. Unpitched
strings under tension replicate the mechanical resistance characteristic of the
original compass. An array of infrared LED / phototransistor pairs, connected to a
microcontroller, was installed within the interface to generate a continuous
stream of data corresponding to the jacks' motion. This paper details the design
principles, development, open-source implementation, and execution of the installation for the San Colombano exhibition.
