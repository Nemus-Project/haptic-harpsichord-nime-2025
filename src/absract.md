This paper describes the design and creation of an electronically augmented replica of a 16th-century harpsichord keyboard with a typical Renaissance Italian layout to create a digital musical instrument. <!-- [1] -->
The keyboard was commissioned for exhibition in a musical instrument museum as an
enhancement to the visitor experience by providing an interface to digitised versions of instruments within the collection. <!-- [2] -->
This project also addresses how we can interact with digitally conserve historic musical instruments when the interface is a limiting factor to the verisimilitude of the experience. <!-- [2,3] -->
This ultimately culminated in a design for an interface capable of new expressions by extending, rather than forfeiting, the characteristics of the original. <!-- [4] -->

The tactile feedback of the keyboard is created by incorporating the same mechanics as a single manual two-register harpsichord with strings under tension in order to replicate the mechanical resistance characteristic of the original compass. <!-- [1] -->
An array of optical sensors connected to a microcontroller was installed within the interface to generate continuous streams of data corresponding to the vertical motion of each jack. <!-- [1, ~4] -->
We outline the details of the keyboard's design principles, technical development, and the motivations behind them. <!-- [1] -->
