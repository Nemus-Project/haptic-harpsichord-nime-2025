Presented is a design for an electronically augmented replica of a 16th century
harpsichord interface, in the style of a Trasuntino from 1547. The interface was
designed, fabricated and exhibited in a collaboration between the NEMUS project
at the Universit√† di Bologna and the Museo San Colombano, which hosts the
Tagliavini Collection of playable historical keyboard instruments. The interface
was commissioned as part of an exhibition and as a means of interacting with
items in the collection that are no longer in playing condition. The keyboard is
a replica of the mechanism found in harpsichords in the Trasuntino style, with
un-pitched strings under tension to provide a comparable mechanical resistance
as found on an original. A system of infra-red LED / phototransistor pairs were
connected to a microcontroller and  installed inside the interface from which a
stream of data can be generated for each jack. The paper covers the design
criteria, process, open-source development and execution of installation for
exhibition at San Colombano.
