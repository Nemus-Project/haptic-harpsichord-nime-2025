	abstract = {In this paper, we reflect on the focus of ``newness'' in NIME research and practice and argue that there is a missing O (for ``Old'') in framing our academic discourse. A systematic review of the last year's conference proceedings reveals that most papers do, indeed, present new instruments, interfaces, or pieces of technology. Comparably few papers focus on the prolongation of existing NIMEs. Our meta-analysis identifies four main categories from these papers: (1) reuse, (2) update, (3) complement, and (4) long-term engagement. We discuss how focusing more on these four types of NIME development and engagement can be seen as an approach to increase sustainability.},

	abstract = {The modular feedback keyboard (MFK) design that we describe in this article was conceived and constructed at ACROE. It was first presented to the public on 17 October, 1989 in Grenoble at the opening celebration of our center's new studio. The system we present is the prototype of a more general device, and its construction is the result of research into the relationship between instrument and performer within the framework of a system for realtime sound synthesis and computer-assisted musical creation. The first feature of this device is that it is a gestural control system with feedback for the tactile senses-it enables actual fingering of a physical instrument to be simulated. The second important feature is that this is a modular system: the piano- or organ-type keyboard is its nominal form, but its mechanical morphology can be modified and easily configured for other applications or types of performance interfaces.},

	abstract = {This Open Access book offers an original interdisciplinary overview of the role of haptic feedback in musical interaction. Divided into two parts, part I examines the tactile aspects of music performance and perception, discussing how they affect user experience and performance in terms of usability, functionality and perceived quality of musical instruments. Part II presents engineering, computational, and design approaches and guidelines that have been applied to render and exploit haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces. Musical Haptics introduces an emerging field that brings together engineering, human-computer interaction, applied psychology, musical aesthetics, and music performance. The latter, defined as the complex system of sensory-motor interactions between musicians and their instruments, presents a well-defined framework in which to study basic psychophysical, perceptual, and biomechanical aspects of touch, all of which will inform the design of haptic musical interfaces. Tactile and proprioceptive cues enable embodied interaction and inform sophisticated control strategies that allow skilled musicians to achieve high performance and expressivity. The use of haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces is expected to enhance user experience and performance, improve accessibility for disabled persons, and provide an effective means for musical tuition and guidance.},

@article{Fritz2017,
	abstract = {Old Italian violins are routinely credited with playing qualities supposedly unobtainable in new instruments. These qualities include the ability to project their sound more effectively in a concert hall---despite seeming relatively quiet under the ear of the player---compared with new violins. Although researchers have long tried to explain the ``mystery'' of Stradivari's sound, it is only recently that studies have addressed the fundamental assumption of tonal superiority. Results from two studies show that, under blind conditions, experienced violinists tend to prefer playing new violins over Old Italians. Moreover, they are unable to tell new from old at better than chance levels. This study explores the relative merits of Stradivari and new violins from the perspective of listeners in a hall. Projection and preference are taken as the two broadest criteria by which listeners might meaningfully compare violins. Which violins are heard better, and which are preferred? In two separate experiments, three new violins were compared with three by Stradivari. Projection was tested both with and without orchestral accompaniment. Projection and preference were judged simultaneously by dividing listeners into two groups. Results are unambiguous. The new violins projected better than the Stradivaris whether tested with orchestra or without, the new violins were generally preferred by the listeners, and the listeners could not reliably distinguish new from old. The single best-projecting violin was considered the loudest under the ear by players, and on average, violins that were quieter under the ear were found to project less well.},

@inproceedings{JackRobertH.2016Eolo,
	abstract = {When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the effects of latency (0-20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms $\pm$ 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

@article{Timmermans2020,
	abstract = {A piano key prototype actuated by a custom-made linear actuator is proposed to enhance the touch of digital pianos by reproducing the force feedback of an acoustic piano action. This paper presents the design and the validation of the haptic device. The approach exploits a multibody model to compute the action dynamics and the corresponding force on the key in real time. More specifically, a grand piano model that includes the five action bodies, its geometry and the specific force laws, is computed in the haptic device. A presizing step along with Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis produced an especially made actuator satisfying the design requirements, in particular the highly dynamic nature of the force to be transmitted. Force peaks, up to 50 (N) in less than 20 (ms), are reachable with low power consumption. Compared to previous solutions: (i) the key physical characteristics are preserved; (ii) the feedback is based on a real-time multibody model that is easily configurable and interchangeable; (iii) an experimental validation of the actuator within the prototype is developed and demonstrates its feasibility. The results confirm that the voice coil can produce suitable haptic feedback. In particular, rendering a grand piano action within the device shows promising haptic force profiles.},

The Novint Falcon force feedback interfaceis used to scan through soundfiles as a subject moves their hand horizontallyfrom left to right, and to relay information about volume, frequency content,noisiness, or potentially any analysable parameter back to the subject throughforces acting on their hand. General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject's hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for`pre-feeling' as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.},

@inproceedings{McAlpine2014,
	abstract = {In the last decade, the heritage sector has had to adapt to a shifting cultural landscape of public expectations and attitudes towards ownership and intellectual property. One way it has done this is to focus on each visitor{\textquoteright}s encounter and provide them with a sense of experiential authenticity.There is a clear desire by the public to engage with music collections in this way, and a sound museological rationale for providing such access, but the approach raises particular curatorial problems, specifically how do we meaningfully balance access with the duty to preserve objects for future generations?This paper charts the development of one such project. Based at Fenton House in Hampstead, and running since 2008, the project seeks to model digitally the keyboard instruments in the Benton Fletcher Collection and provide a dedicated interactive exhibit, which allows visitors to view all of the instruments in situ, and then play them through a custom-built two-manual MIDI controller with touch-screen interface.We discuss the approach to modelling, which uses high-definition sampling, and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the exhibit as it currently stands, with particular focus on its key shortcoming: at present, there is no way to effectively model the key feel of a historic keyboard instrument.This issue is of profound importance, since the feel of any instrument is fundamental to its character, and shapes the way performers relate to it. The issue is further compounded if we are to consider a single dedicated keyboard as being the primary mode of interface for several instrument models of different classes, each with its own characteristic feel.We conclude by proposing an outline solution to this problem, detailing early work on a real-time adaptive haptic keyboard interface that changes its action in response to sampled resistance curves, measured on a key-by-key basis from the original instruments.},

 abstract = {The Hyper-Ney is a hyperinstrument prototype enhancing the traditional ney flute by integrating electronic sensors to expand creative possibilities beyond its affordances. These allow the control of sound synthesis and processing parameters to create a blend of acoustic and synthesized sounds. The core idea is to remap the existing fingering gestures, exploiting acoustically unresponsive holes of the ney flute for enhanced control. Additional interaction methods include lip positioning and instrument movement. We evaluated the system through a study focused on audience reactions, suggesting engaging sonic and visual elements. We complemented this evaluation by including the first author's self-reflections as Hyper-Ney performer.},
