	abstract = {This Open Access book offers an original interdisciplinary overview of the role of haptic feedback in musical interaction. Divided into two parts, part I examines the tactile aspects of music performance and perception, discussing how they affect user experience and performance in terms of usability, functionality and perceived quality of musical instruments. Part II presents engineering, computational, and design approaches and guidelines that have been applied to render and exploit haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces. Musical Haptics introduces an emerging field that brings together engineering, human-computer interaction, applied psychology, musical aesthetics, and music performance. The latter, defined as the complex system of sensory-motor interactions between musicians and their instruments, presents a well-defined framework in which to study basic psychophysical, perceptual, and biomechanical aspects of touch, all of which will inform the design of haptic musical interfaces. Tactile and proprioceptive cues enable embodied interaction and inform sophisticated control strategies that allow skilled musicians to achieve high performance and expressivity. The use of haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces is expected to enhance user experience and performance, improve accessibility for disabled persons, and provide an effective means for musical tuition and guidance.},

@article{FritzClaudia2017Leon,
	abstract = {Old Italian violins are routinely credited with playing qualities supposedly unobtainable in new instruments. These qualities include the ability to project their sound more effectively in a concert hall---despite seeming relatively quiet under the ear of the player---compared with new violins. Although researchers have long tried to explain the ``mystery'' of Stradivari's sound, it is only recently that studies have addressed the fundamental assumption of tonal superiority. Results from two studies show that, under blind conditions, experienced violinists tend to prefer playing new violins over Old Italians. Moreover, they are unable to tell new from old at better than chance levels. This study explores the relative merits of Stradivari and new violins from the perspective of listeners in a hall. Projection and preference are taken as the two broadest criteria by which listeners might meaningfully compare violins. Which violins are heard better, and which are preferred? In two separate experiments, three new violins were compared with three by Stradivari. Projection was tested both with and without orchestral accompaniment. Projection and preference were judged simultaneously by dividing listeners into two groups. Results are unambiguous. The new violins projected better than the Stradivaris whether tested with orchestra or without, the new violins were generally preferred by the listeners, and the listeners could not reliably distinguish new from old. The single best-projecting violin was considered the loudest under the ear by players, and on average, violins that were quieter under the ear were found to project less well.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a portable optical measurement system for capturingcontinuous key motion on any piano. Very few concert venues have MIDI-enabledpianos, and many performers depend on the versatile but discontinued MoogPianoBar to provide MIDI from a conventional acoustic instrument. The scannerhardware presented in this paper addresses the growing need for alternativesolutions while surpassing existing systems in the level of detail measured.Continuous key position on both black and white keys is gathered at 1kHz samplerate. Software extracts traditional and novel features of keyboard touch fromeach note, which can be flexibly mapped to sound using MIDI or Open SoundControl. RGB LEDs provide rich visual feedback to assist the performer ininteracting with more complex sound mapping arrangements. An application ispresented to the magnetic resonator piano, an electromagnetically-augmentedacoustic grand piano which is performed using continuous key positionmeasurements.},

@inproceedings{JackRobertH.2016Eolo,
	abstract = {When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the effects of latency (0-20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms $\pm$ 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},
